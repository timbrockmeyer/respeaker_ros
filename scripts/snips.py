#monitor the inbuilt SPEECHRECOGNIZED trigger of the respeaker mic array 2.0
#when it turns to 1, tell snips to listen via mosquitto
#receive snips recognition via mosquitto and broadcast it to ROS as well

#bonus: mute when pepper is speaking (pepper speaking node should be constantly rospy-written to a global variable, we can not make a call once we want to start recording, that is too slow)
#bonus: nice LED feedback
